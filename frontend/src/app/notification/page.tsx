                    Bug Buster is in alpha stage, which means its development is
                    heavily active, and changes (such as fixes and improvements)
                    can come at any time.

                    Regarding security, Bug Buster is built on top of the
                    Cartesi Rollups SDK and developed with meticulous care and
                    attention to detail. However, we cannot guarantee that the
                    platform is entirely free of bugs or vulnerabilities at this
                    stage.

                    use the platform with caution, and avoid depositing large
                    amounts of funds.
